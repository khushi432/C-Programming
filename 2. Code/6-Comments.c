/*
Comments in C
Comments can be used to explain code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.

Comments can be singled-lined or multi-lined
*/

/*
Single-line Comments
Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).

Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by the compiler (will not be executed).

This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:

Example
// This is a comment
printf("Hello World!");

*/


/*
C Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments start with  and ends with.

Any text between  and  will be ignored by the compiler:

Example

The code below will print the words Hello World!
to the screen, and it is amazing 
printf("Hello World!");

*/

/*
Single or multi-line comments?
It is up to you which you want to use. Normally, we use // for short comments, and  for longer.

Good to know: Before version C99 (released in 1999), you could only use multi-line comments in C.
